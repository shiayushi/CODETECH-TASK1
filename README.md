**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

--TASK 1-- 

Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous
target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared
error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the
regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy
